# Footprint sketch

## Bake ownership

A sketch bakes into footprint fields that can also be authored without it:
a `.snxfpt` written by hand or by an import, silk drawn in Pads mode. An
empty bake must therefore not clear every field. The sketch **owns** a
kind when either holds:

- an entity of the sketch is tagged for it (`silk` on `TopSilk` owns
  `silk_f`, on `BottomSilk` owns `silk_b`; `courtyard`, `mask_opening`,
  `mask_exclude`, `paste_aperture`, `pour`, `keepout`, `board_cutout`,
  `v_score` own the kind of the same name), or
- an earlier bake produced it and recorded it in `baked_kinds`.

A non-empty bake replaces the field and records the kind. An empty bake
clears a field only when the sketch owns the kind, reports the clear in the
Messages panel, and drops the record so geometry drawn afterwards is safe.
Pads are always sketch-owned once the sketch has an entity, and are
recorded as `pads` so that deleting every entity clears them too. A sketch
that never baked has an empty record and owns nothing: entering Sketch mode
on a footprint with literal pads leaves them alone.

Legacy gap: a footprint saved by an older build whose tagged entity was
already deleted has no record and keeps that geometry (it cannot be told
from imported geometry; there is no migration). The same holds for pads: if
the first edit in a newer build deletes every entity of a sketch baked by an
older build, the sketch-baked pads are kept, as they were before.

A non-empty silk bake still replaces the whole of `silk_f` / `silk_b`,
hand-drawn entries included: baked entries are not marked by origin.

### File format

`sketch.baked_kinds` is a list of strings, written only when non-empty and
read with a default, so a file the sketch never baked saves byte-identical
and an older file loads. Tokens: `silk_f`, `silk_b`, `courtyard`,
`mask_openings`, `mask_excludes`, `paste_apertures`, `pours`, `keepouts`,
`cutouts`, `v_scores`, `pads`. A token is never renamed or reused for another
meaning; a token this build does not know is kept as read.

## Redundant constraints

`FullSolveOutput.redundant_constraints` names consistent constraints whose
every Jacobian row is implied by the EARLIER constraints (and the arc
closures), so the verdict depends on constraint order and names the later
duplicate. They are listed under "Redundant" in the footprint editor's
DOF / Last solve section. Conflicts are reported separately as
over-constrained.
