# Main menu bar

The bar is plain data: `menu_bar_model(&MenuContext)` in
`crates/signex-app/src/menu_bar/model/` builds it, and `menu_bar/view.rs`
renders it as iced_aw menus. Its content is pinned by
`menu_bar/testdata/menu_bar.golden.tsv`; changing a menu, label, shortcut,
order or message is a content change and needs the maintainers' sign-off.

## File ▸ Library {#file-library}

File ▸ Library carries only "Open Library..." (libraries outside the active
project) and the canvas-side "Place Component..." picker. Creating a new
component moved to the project tree: right-click ▸ Add New to Project ▸
Component Library, then Add New ▸ Component on the library node.

## File ▸ Export ▸ PDF {#file-export-pdf}

Print Preview used to be a top-level File row that duplicated Export ▸ PDF's
shortcut. The two were consolidated under Export ▸ PDF so one surface opens
the preview flow. Ctrl+P still opens the preview through the keymap command
bridge (`app/command/bridge.rs`); only the menu row moved.

## Save and Save As {#file-save}

Both are also enabled for a standalone symbol or footprint editor tab
(`.snxsym` / `.snxfpt`), which `save_active_document` already handles, so the
gate is the command's enablement, not "a schematic is open".
